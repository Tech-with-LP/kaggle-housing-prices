# Kaggle Housing Prices

This repository contains the code and data analysis for the Kaggle housing prices dataset. Our goal is to build predictive models to estimate house prices using various features available in the dataset.

Welcome to our deep dive into the world of real estate pricing! Have you ever wondered what factors influence the price of a house? Maybe you have thought about how different features like number of bedrooms or size of the yard play a role. In this project, we will explore a dataset that includes information about houses in Ames, Iowa. Each house in the dataset comes with a variety of features, such as number of bedrooms, the size of the garage, and even the year it was built. Our main goal is use these features to predict the sale price of each house.

We will start by getting familiar with the dataset - where it comes from, what kind of information it contains, and how it is structured. Then, we will move on to analyzing the data to find interesting patterns and trends. Next, we will use some techniques to clean and transform the data, making it easier for our machine learning models to understand and make predictions. Finally, we will build and test different models to find how accurately we can predict housing prices.
